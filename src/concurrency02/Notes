Thread Pool ::
Thread pool is a place where I keep my threads and if there is any task,
my thread can just pick a task from there and start executing it.

Executor Service / Executors is a implementation of Thread Pool in Java.

--> Executors have 2 types of ThreadPool implementation::
1. FixedThreadPool  --> no.of threads will be fixed in this case  when we create Executor Service object.
2. CachedThreadPool  --> if all the threads are busy and there is a need of a thread,
                         it will create a thread, otherwise it will use the idle thread.

If we have a usecase where we have to return something, we have to use "CALLABLE" Interface.
because "Runnable" cannot return.

CALLABLE is a Generic Interface.

--> RUNNABLE -----> run()
--> CALLABLE -----> call()
